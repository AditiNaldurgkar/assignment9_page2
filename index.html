        A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa in the family Rosaceae ,or the flower it bears. 
        There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that 
        can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[5] Their flowers vary in 
        size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through 
        yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, 
        North America, and northwestern Africa.
